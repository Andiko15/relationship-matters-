    <p>My ideal relationship is the one built on utmost honesty, trust and friendship. The meaning of friendship from the psychology dictionary is “ a voluntary relationship between people that lasts a long time and those involved are concerned
      about each other. It develops from shared interests and experiences and is mutually gratifying”. My understanding of a friend is someone who takes you as you are, who sees the real you and still finds value in you, someone who knows your
      skeletons in your closet and still finds you adorable. Someone you argue with for hours because you disagree on so many things but still find a balance at the end of it all because friends understand each other and can easily reach a space of
      compromise.</p>
    <p>With the current world where people are materialistic, value popularity, it becomes hard to focus on the real important things that matter in any relationship. We live in a society where people are emotional wrecks seeking for instant
      gratification. With this trend, we end up missing out on true connections and true friendships. Times have really changed and people are too busy and we don't find time to get to know the people in our lives. </p>
    <p>You get married to an idea of a person that was created in you since the beginning of the dating phase. Mark you that’s not the real person and your expectations are set on unrealistic goals. Fact is unmet expectations lead to frustrations.
      At the end of it all, you become frustrated when you discover that the idea in your head doesn’t exist and this kind of disappointment breeds contempt, and you wonder why married people who were so much in love end up hating each other and
      always fighting. It’s the disappointment brought about by the unmet expectations! </p>
    <p>Maslow’s hierarchy of needs ranks love and belonging to the third human need. We all strive for acceptance in the society and this leads us to create a picture of ourselves that will be accepted by people around us. We seek glorification in
      different ways which is unnecessary. When you make a decision to become real, you may not find your match easily, but the one person who will stick with you becomes your most ideal partner, true to you. It takes a lot of effort, patience and
      understanding to deal with people in their real selves but that is the foundation of a solid relationship!</p>
